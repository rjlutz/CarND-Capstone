I worked alone - I am Bob Lutz rlutz@ggc.edu

I'm still working on the classifier and will resubmit before the deadline if I get it working. I am submitting now to be sure that I get the submission in (with the parts that are working)  before the deadline. 

My car does drive around the track and stop at the stop lines.
